# Exercise: Calculate the area of a rectangle

# Given dimensions of a rectangle
length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula: area = length * width
area = length * width

# Print the result
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)


# Exercise: Calculate BMI

# Given weight in kilograms and height in meters
weight_kg = 70
height_m = 1.75

# Calculate BMI using the formula: bmi = weight / (height^2)
bmi = weight_kg / (height_m ** 2)

# Print the result
print("BMI:", bmi)


# Exercise: Calculate age difference

# Given birth years of two individuals
birth_year_person1 = 1990
birth_year_person2 = 1985

# Calculate the age difference
age_difference = birth_year_person1 - birth_year_person2

# Print the result
print("Age Difference:", age_difference)


# Exercise: Calculate average speed

# Given distance in kilometers and time in hours
distance_km = 150
time_hours = 2.5

# Calculate average speed using the formula: speed = distance / time
average_speed = distance_km / time_hours

# Print the result
print("Average Speed:", average_speed, "km/h")


# Exercise: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

# Given temperature in Celsius
celsius_temperature = 25

# Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
fahrenheit_temperature = (celsius_temperature * 9/5) + 32

# Print the result
print("The temperature in Fahrenheit is:", fahrenheit_temperature)


# Exercise: Calculate simple interest

# Given principal amount, interest rate, and time in years
principal = 1000
interest_rate = 0.05
time_years = 3

# Calculate simple interest using the formula: interest = principal * rate * time
simple_interest = principal * interest_rate * time_years

# Print the result
print("The simple interest is:", simple_interest)


# Exercise: Calculate the area of a circle

# Given radius of the circle
radius = 7

# Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: area = Ï€ * radius^2
pi = 3.14159
circle_area = pi * (radius ** 2)

# Print the result
print("The area of the circle is:", circle_area)

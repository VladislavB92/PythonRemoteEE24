# Warmup exercises:

# 1. variable that contains the greeting with your name

Welcoming_words = 'Greetings from Monika'
# 2 variable that contains current weather temperature in float datatype

temp = 1.0

# 3 variable that contains the city you live in
city = 'PÃ¤rnu'

# 4 variable that contains the number of pets you have

pets = 1
# 5 sum up the weather and the number of pets you have. Save the sum in a new variable

temp_plus_pets = temp + pets

# 6 subtract the number of plants you have in your house from the animals you have. Save the result in a separate variable


plants_and_pet = 3 + 1

# Given dimensions of a rectangle

length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula: area = length * width

# formula: area = length * width
print(area)

# Given birth years of two individuals
birth_year_person1 = 1990
birth_year_person2 = 1985

difference = birth_year_person1 - birth_year_person2

print(difference)

# Given distance in kilometers and time in hours
distance_km = 150
time_hours = 2.5

speed = distance_km / time_hours

print(speed)

# Given temperature in Celsius

celsius_temperature = 25

fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32

# Print the result

print('temperature_in_fahrenheit_is, fahrenheit')

# 7. Interest calculation

# Given principal amount, interest rate, and time in years
principal = 1000
interest_rate = 0.05
time_years = 3

# Calculate simple interest using the formula: interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result

print('interest is', interest)

# 8. Calculate the area of a circle

# Given radius of the circle
radius = 7

# Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: area = pi * radius^2
pi = 3.14159

area = pi * radius * 2

# Print the result

print(area)

# SUPER TASK

# Calculate BMI (body mass index)

# Make an input prompt in the terminal that accepts the users weight in kilograms
# and height in meters. Use the input() function (google the usage)

# Using the values the user entered, calculate BMI using the formula: bmi = weight / (height^2)

weight = Int(input('enter your weight in kg:'))
height = float(input('enter your height in meters: '))

# Using the values the user entered, calculate BMI using the formula: bmi = weight / (height^2)

# Print the result

print(bmi)
